This project focuses on developing an NLP-based drug recommendation system that uses machine learning and deep learning models to analyze patient reviews and classify them into positive, neutral, or negative sentiments. It leverages advanced models like BERT, RoBERTa, DistilBERT, alongside traditional models like Logistic Regression and SVM, to accurately assess patient feedback. Feature extraction techniques such as TF-IDF and Word2Vec help capture the context and meaning of the text data. The project also incorporates a Recommender System that combines content-based and collaborative filtering methods to provide personalized drug recommendations based on sentiment analysis. Evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrices ensure the models' performance, with the goal of improving personalized healthcare by considering real-world patient experiences.
